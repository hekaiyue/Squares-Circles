completely changed project to blockhero. 

Created character, hero, and minion classes. Created physics for hero movement (including fast speed-up initially and then slower speedup,
friction to slow down after letting go of keys, and stop hero by pressing button).
working now on minion movement, which turns out is much harder than I thought it was going to be, scrapped several times. Currently
trying to get each minion to follow within a certain distance behind the previous minion (ends up looking like a line formation).

Can demo hero physics by running blockhero2.py and moving with up/down/left/right. Spacebar stops the hero. When you press an arrow
and then let go, after a while it will stop. Also, say you press up for a little bit, and then hold down the right key. It will go
up at first, then slowly go more right, then be completely going towards the right.
